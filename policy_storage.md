# Policy: Storage Policies

Members often want to store things at ENTS, however the society is limited on space and would prefer to keep things neat and tidy where possible. To accomplish this, a set of policies is enacted on all members (past and present) to follow. Each area may define specific policies which override or append to the general storage policies.

These storage policies apply to member-owned materials, tools, projects, etc (known as “Items”). Projects involving multiple members should be distributed among the members involved - if this is not possible, the Board must give explicit approval for special consideration. Items owned by the Society (eg: donated pottery glazes, laser materials, K-Days demos, etc) are not covered by these policies, however it is expected that the Society respect these policies where possible.



1. **General policies**

    1. Members are permitted maximum 2 Bins to store items in the space, known as Member’s Bins.
    2. Member’s Bins must be 11 Litre, 53 Litre, or 68 Litre Rubbermaid RoughNeck totes. Preferably blue in colour. Other sizes, brands, and colours may be approved at the discretion of the Board.
    3. Member’s Bins must be labeled with the member’s full name (first and last).
    4. Items not covered by area-specific policies are to be stored in the Member’s Bins while the member is away from the space.
    5. Member’s Bins must be placed in the dedicated member storage area provided by the Society.
    6. 3 months after membership lapses, Member’s Bins and Items are eligible to become donations to the Society at the discretion of the Board.

        1. Prior to considering items as donations, the Board must give reasonable notice to the member so that they may collect their Items.

    7. Large Items which do not fit into the Member’s Bins or other area-specific policies must have explicit written approval from the Board before storing them at the space.
