* Where Single Transferrable Voting is used, the following method will apply:
* The number of votes needed to win is determined by the following equation: (x / y + 1) + 1, where x is equal to the number of valid votes cast, and y is equal to the number of seats to be filled.  Where the quota is not an integer, it is rounded up.
* The election proceeds through a series of rounds
    * Any candidates who receive sufficient first preference votes to meet or exceed the required number of votes are elected
    * If after counting all of the first preference votes candidates remain to be elected,
      * The second preferences of the candidate with the least amount of first preference votes are re-allocated to the remaining unelected candidates.
      * If the number of votes received by the elected candidate exceeds the number of votes required for election, the surplus votes are re-allocated to the second preferences of the winning candidate’s voters, in proportion to that candidate’s voters’ second choice preferences
    * This method will continue until the required number of candidates reach the required number of votes.
