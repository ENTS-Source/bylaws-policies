# Policy: Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the ENTS community, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behaviour. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all, and expect our code of conduct to be honoured. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community. This Code of Conduct applies to all communications between past, present, and future ENTS members.

ENTS expects all members to:

- **Be friendly and patient.**
- **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
- **Be considerate**: Your projects and work at ENTS may inspire other people, and you in turn may depend on the work of others. Any decision you take may affect other members of ENTS or the public, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're welcoming of all backgrounds, so you may not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
- **Be respectful**: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
- **Be careful in the words that we choose**: Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour aren't acceptable.
- **Try to understand why we disagree**: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

### Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour — or have any other concerns — please report it by contacting us via <directors@ents.ca>. All reports will be handled with discretion.
